    "PURPOSECONTENT":"The purpose of the Sustainability Assessment is to help organisations teams quickly identify whether they are addressing the full range of sustainability criteria in their projects. The success of this Sustainable Assessment hinges on clearly defining the boundary/scope of analysis upfront. This includes specifying the physical locations, dimensions, and types of infrastructure to be assessed. Maintaining consistency in these parameters throughout the checklist is crucial.      The assessment presents the sustainability criteria as yes/no questions. When few of the assessment questions are addressed, they may have the opportunity for improvement by revisiting their project objectives and expanding their sustainability considerations to address more criteria. Conversely, when they address many of the assessment criteria, they demonstrate that their approach is sufficiently broad.",
    "PROCEDURE":"PROCEDURE:",
    "PROCEDURECONTENT":"For the purposes of this Sustainable Assessment, a Project will be considered to be any infrastructure, regardless of whether it is in the design, construction, or completed stages. There are six tabs, one for each of the  categories: Social Impact, Governance, Life-cycle Resources, Environment, Risk and Resilience, and Castling. Each category tab lists the credits, -sustainability criteria- and assessment questions. There are a total of 67 credits. Each credit contains an intent, metric, and assessment questions. The intent describes the purpose of the credit and how it contributes to sustainability. The metric explains how the organisation and/or project team can be successful in meeting the intent of the credit. Users are first asked to identify whether a credit is applicable or not by selecting 'yes' or 'no'. The points associated with credits deemed not applicable by selecting 'no' are set to zero. For those credits deemed to be applicable by selecting 'yes', users are to address the subsequent assessment questions. The assessment questions determine if the organisation and/or project meet the intent for that credit. The questions require users to select 'yes' or 'no' from a drop down menu. Some questions will also require a user to select an additional response from a drop down list below the specific question - these questions have the prompt 'Select from one of the following'. Questions left unaddressed are assumed to be answered as 'no'.  "
