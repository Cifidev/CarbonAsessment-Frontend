    <p>PURPOSE:

      You've diligently worked through the Pre-assessment Checklist, bringing CPSI considerations into the early stages of your project or organizational planning. By navigating the yes/no questions of the checklist, you've taken an important step towards understanding where your sustainability efforts currently stand. This reflection on the comprehensive range of sustainability criteria has prepared you to uncover the estimated score your organization or project might achieve. Should your assessment reveal areas with fewer addressed questions, it highlights a valuable opportunity for growth. It's a chance to revisit and refine your project objectives, expanding your sustainability efforts to encompass a broader array of criteria. On the flip side, a high number of addressed criteria showcases your broad approach, positioning you as a strong candidate for setting more detailed performance goals within the CPSI programme.
      
      PROCEDURE:
      </p><p>
      After traversing through the six category tabs—Quality of Life, Leadership, Resource Allocation, Natural World, Climate and Resilience, and Castling—you've engaged with the 67 credits that form the backbone of this checklist. Each credit, with its intent, metric, and crucial assessment questions, guided you in evaluating your project's alignment with sustainable practices. Your thoughtful consideration in selecting 'yes' or 'no' for each credit's applicability, and your responses to subsequent questions, have painted a detailed picture of your sustainability profile. Remember, unanswered questions default to 'no', emphasizing the importance of thorough engagement with the checklist.
    </p><p>
      
      As you stand on the brink of pressing "See My Score," it's essential to remember that this score is a starting point. It offers an estimate, not a final verdict, on your sustainability journey. The insights gained here are invaluable for guiding your next steps, whether that means deepening your sustainability commitments or broadening your approach to cover more criteria.
